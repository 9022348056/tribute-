                <p>
                    <b>Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam</b>, born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, was an eminent Indian scientist and the 11th President of India, 
                    known as the "Missile Man of India" for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He played a crucial 
                    role in India's 1998 nuclear tests and worked extensively at ISRO and DRDO. As President from 2002 to 2007, he was beloved for his humility and connection with the youth,
                    promoting education and technological advancement. His notable works include his autobiography "Wings of Fire" and other influential books like "Ignited Minds" and "India 2020."
                    Dr. Kalam was honored with numerous awards, including the Bharat Ratna, and passed away on July 27, 2015, while delivering a lecture, leaving behind a legacy of inspiration and visionary leadership.
